# VausGamingPaddle
Arkanoid inspired game paddle for playing Arkanoid 1 or 2 retro games or any other breakout-inspired ball game of the 90's.
The paddle only works if it is played at the bottom of the screen.
The arduino micro powered device is 
- emulating a mouse with only X direction and features 1 button
- the main sensor bar is a very smooth 128mm linear potentiometer of resistance 10 KOhm
- paddle movements are accompanied by led effect when moving and firing
- handles the left and right corners by moving the mouse faster
- features a mouse acceleration (not fully linear)
- sentitivity is can be changed (per game) by user using a potentiometer. Useful as screen resolution may differ from one game to the other.
- when idle for a few seconds, starts a beautiful led fireworks demo called "DemoReel100" by Fastled, found here :https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/tree/master/examples/DemoReel100
- body is 3d printed (models are to be found for free on thingiverse)
- main paddle element is shaped to resemble the Arkanoid 1 spaceship
- connexion to a PC or retro console via standard USB A plug
