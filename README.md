# VausGamingPaddle

I created a 3D printed, open sourced, arduino based, "Arkanoid"-inspired game paddle for playing Arkanoid 1 or 2 games realistically.

Also works with other "breakout" inspired ball game that accept USB mouse as input.

Reference:
https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid

This game controller is 
- emulating a mouse with only X direction
- has 1 button (for Arkanoid game it is used as fire button)
- main sensor bar is a very smooth large linear potentiometer, like the ones found on DJ mixer devices
- paddle movements are accompanied by led effect when moving and firing
- handles the left and right corners by moving the mouse faster
- some mouse acceleration based on mouse speed
- sentitivity can be changed by user using a potentiometer. Useful as screen resolution may differ from one game to the other.
- when idle for a few seconds, starts a beautiful led fireworks demo called "DemoReel100" by Fastled, found here: https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED/tree/master/examples/DemoReel100
- body is 3d printed (models are to be found for free on thingiverse, link for download for free : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6772436 )
- main paddle element is shaped to resemble the Arkanoid 1 spaceship
- connexion to a PC or retro console via standard USB A plug
